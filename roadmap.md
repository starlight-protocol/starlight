- **SDK Hardening**: Atomic writes, proper exceptions, auto-reconnect. [DONE]
- **Screenshot Cleanup**: Auto-removes files older than 24h. [DONE]
- **Trace Rotation**: Limits mission trace to 500 events. [DONE]
- **Starlight CLI**: Advanced project scaffolding and constellation management. [DONE]
  - `starlight init <name>` - Scaffold new CBA projects
  - `starlight create <sentinel>` - Generate Sentinel boilerplate
  - `starlight run` - Launch Hub + Sentinels constellation
  - `starlight doctor` - Environment diagnostics
  - `starlight triage` - Time-travel debugging UI

## � PHASE 9: Sovereign Security & Compliance (COMPLETED)
*Turning CBA into a Shield for Enterprise Environments.*
- **PII Sentinel**: Passive sentinel for detecting and alerting on sensitive data in the UI. [DONE]
- **Traffic Sovereign**: Network-level request blocking and chaos engineering via the Hub. [DONE]

- **Alerting Webhooks**: Slack/Teams/Discord notifications on mission completion. [DONE]
- **SLA Tracking**: Automated compliance reporting (uptime, MTTR metrics). [PLANNED]

## ☁️ PHASE 11: Multi-Tenant Cloud Platform
*CBA as a managed service.*
- **Hub-as-a-Service**: REST API to spawn ephemeral browser sessions on demand. [PLANNED]
