# 🛰️ Constellation-Based Automation (CBA)
## Starlight Protocol v2.8 — The Sovereign Security Era

**"Don't look at the ground; look at the Starlight."**

CBA is a philosophical shift in browser automation. Inspired by biological navigation (like the dung beetle using the Milky Way), this framework moves away from linear scripts that handle every possible UI obstacle. Instead, it uses a **Sovereign Constellation** of autonomous agents (Sentinels) that orient toward high-level goals.

## 🏗️ The Sovereign Constellation

![CBA Architecture](architecture.png)

CBA uses a **Decentralized Sidecar Architecture** communicating over a JSON-RPC message bus.

| Layer | Role |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Intent Layer** | High-level business intent. Selector-less (e.g., `{ goal: 'Login' }`). |
| **The Hub** | Orchestrates Playwright, resolves semantic goals, manages **Sovereign Context**. |
| **Vision Sentinel** | Uses local SLMs (Moondream) for visual obstacle detection. |
| **Janitor Sentinel** | Heuristic background process that clears modals and overlays. |
| **Pulse Sentinel** | Monitors network/DOM jitter for **Wait-Less** temporal stability. |
| **Data Sentinel** | Passively extracts metadata and injects it into the shared context. |
| **PII Sentinel** | Detects and alerts on sensitive data exposure. |

---

## ✨ What's New in v2.8

### 🛡️ Phase 9: Sovereign Security & Compliance

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Shadow DOM Penetration** | Deep-piercing `>>>` selectors for web components |
| **PII Sentinel** | Privacy-first sensitive data detection |
| **Traffic Sovereign** | Network blocking & chaos engineering |
| **Shadow-Aware Janitor** | Clears obstacles inside shadow roots |

### 🔮 Shadow DOM Support

```javascript
// CBA automatically pierces shadow boundaries
{ goal: 'ESCAPE SHADOW' }  // Finds button inside <shadow-modal>
```

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for full history.

## 🛰️ The Starlight Protocol

Standardized signals for zero-wait, selector-less autonomy:

| Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `starlight.intent` | Issues a high-level `goal` or `cmd`. |
| `starlight.pre_check` | Handshake broadcast with screenshot for AI analysis. |
| `starlight.wait` | Veto due to environmental instability. |
| `starlight.hijack` | Request absolute browser lock for healing. |
| `starlight.context_update` | Inject intelligence into the shared mission state. |

---

## 🛠️ The Starlight SDK (Python)

Build a sentinel in minutes:

```python
from sdk.starlight_sdk import SentinelBase

class MySentinel(SentinelBase):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(layer_name="MySentinel", priority=10)
        self.capabilities = ["custom-healing"]

    async def on_pre_check(self, params, msg_id):
        # Your custom healing logic here
        await self.send_clear()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(MySentinel().start())
```

**SDK Features:**
- ✅ Auto-reconnect on connection failure
- ✅ Persistent memory (JSON-based)
- ✅ Graceful shutdown (SIGINT/SIGTERM)
- ✅ Atomic file writes
- ✅ Config-driven settings

---

## 🌌 Phase 7: The Galaxy Mesh

CBA is a **Self-Learning Ecosystem** that gets smarter with every mission:

### 🧠 Self-Healing Selectors
When a selector fails, CBA automatically tries alternatives from memory:

```
Mission 1: Goal "Login" → #login-btn → SUCCESS ✓
           (Learned and saved to memory)
           
Mission 2: Goal "Login" → #login-btn (changed to .new-login!)
           FAIL → Hub checks historical memory
           Tries #login-btn from memory → SUCCESS ✓
           Report shows "SELF-HEALED" badge
```

### ⏱️ Animation Tolerance (v2.8)
For animated sites, CBA force-proceeds after 3 stability checks:
- **PulseSentinel** detects DOM mutations from animations
- After 3 vetoes, Hub uses "Animation Tolerance" to continue
- No more infinite blocking from CSS animations!

### 🔮 Aura Throttling
CBA learns when your site is historically unstable:
- Tracks 500ms "entropy buckets" from past runs
- Proactively slows down during known jitter windows
- Prevents flakiness before it happens

### 📈 ROI Dashboard
The `report.html` quantifies business value:
- **Triage Savings**: Minutes saved per obstacle cleared
- **Self-Healing Credits**: Automated selector fixes
- **Aura Stabilization**: Predictive jitter avoidance
- **Visual Proof**: Before/after screenshots

## 🎮 GUI Launcher (Mission Control)

A visual control panel for starting Hub, Sentinels, and running missions:

```bash
# Start the launcher
node launcher/server.js

# Open in browser
http://localhost:3000
```

**Features:**
- 🟢 Status indicators for Hub, PulseSentinel, JanitorSentinel
- ▶️ Start All / Stop All buttons
- 🚀 Mission dropdown with Launch button
- 📋 Live logs console with real-time output
- 📊 Quick link to view report
