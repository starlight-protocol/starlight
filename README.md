# Starlight

**A general-purpose agent platform for turning goals into inspectable outcomes.**

Starlight runs agents that work with code, data, APIs, browsers, devices, or language models.
You supply a goal and its boundaries. Agents decide whether they can handle it and own the
implementation. The platform routes work, bounds execution, coordinates mission steps, and
returns a report with agent identity, attempts, results, and evidence.

This JavaScript/Node.js alpha includes an embeddable runtime, a local CLI, and an authenticated
protocol for remote agents. You supply domain agents; arbitrary natural-language planning
requires an agent that implements it. No model provider or browser is required.

## Run something real

Requires Node.js 22 or newer. From this checkout:

```bash
npm ci
npm run demo
```

Two agents read the included order data, independently verify its total, write a Markdown
summary, and read the file back to verify it. The expected result is **3 orders, 5500 cents**.
Each run creates a fresh artifact and JSON report under `.starlight/runs/`.
The CLI prints the run ID, results, evidence, and report path.

```bash
node bin/starlight-platform.js inspect <run-id>
node bin/starlight-platform.js runs --status completed --limit 10
node bin/starlight-platform.js validate examples/data-report/mission.json
node bin/starlight-platform.js agents --agents examples/data-report/agents.cjs
node bin/starlight-platform.js run examples/data-report/mission.json --agents examples/data-report/agents.cjs
```

The last command writes `.starlight/order-summary.md` and fails if it already exists. Change
the mission's output path for another run, or use `npm run demo` for a fresh path each time.
After installing a package built from this checkout, the equivalent commands are `starlight demo`,
`starlight run`, `starlight agents`, `starlight validate`, `starlight inspect`, and `starlight runs`.

## Write an agent

```js
const { AgentPlatform } = require('@starlight-protocol/starlight');
const platform = new AgentPlatform();

platform.register({
  name: 'word-counter',
  capabilities: ['text'],
  canHandle: intent => intent.goal === 'Count the words',
  run: async intent => {
    if (typeof intent.context.text !== 'string') {
      return { status: 'failed', error: 'context.text must be a string' };
    }
    const words = intent.context.text.match(/\S+/g) || [];
    return { status: 'completed', value: { words: words.length } };
  }
});

async function main() {
  const report = await platform.run({
    goal: 'Count the words',
    context: { text: 'Goals become observable results' }
  });
  console.log(report.status, report.steps[0].result?.value);
}
main().catch(console.error);
```

`canHandle` offers a claim without changing anything; `run` does the work. Optional `verify`
checks a completed outcome before the mission continues. Agents may use deterministic code,
tools, models, or their own planning. The platform does not interpret goals on their behalf.

## Compose a mission

Register the agents exported by [the data-report example](examples/data-report/agents.cjs), then:

```js
const handle = platform.submit({
  goal: 'Produce a verified summary of the order data',
  context: { inputPath: './orders.json', outputPath: './summary.md' },
  constraints: { maxRows: 1000 },
  steps: ['Summarize the order data', 'Write the verified order summary']
});

// platform.getRun(handle.id) returns a snapshot of progress.
// handle.cancel() cooperatively cancels work and stops later steps.
const report = await handle.done;
```

Steps run in order and are routed independently. Agents receive preceding results in
`intent.context.mission.results`. Mission constraints apply to every step and cannot be
redefined by a step. Failure, verification failure, cancellation, or a deadline stops the mission.

**Inspect the report status:** completed, failed, and cancelled missions return a report with
their history. Invalid mission definitions throw before execution. Calling `run` again creates
a new execution with a new ID.

## Keep progress across process exits

The CLI now saves atomic progress checkpoints before and after each step. Add `--events`
for JSONL progress on stderr and `--timeout-ms 60000` for a whole-mission execution budget.
The SDK exposes the same features:

```js
const { AgentPlatform, FileRunStore } = require('@starlight-protocol/starlight');
const store = new FileRunStore('./runs');
const platform = new AgentPlatform({ store });
platform.subscribe(event => console.log(event.type, event.run.id));
// Register your agents, then run a mission with { timeoutMs: 60000 }.
// await store.list({ status: 'failed' }) finds saved run summaries after a restart.
```

Storage failure stops new work and rejects the run handle. An interrupted run preserves its
last checkpoint; a saved `running` step may already have produced an effect. Inspect its
evidence before starting fresh work. See [run storage, deadlines, and recovery boundaries](docs/RUNS.md).

## Connect an API to a mission

`createHttpJsonAgent` provides HTTP GET integration with an explicit origin allowlist, response
size limits, cancellation, JSON parsing, and optional domain verification. Results and HTTP
evidence flow into later mission steps. Credentials stay in agent configuration.

Try the service-health workflow against its temporary local fixture endpoint:

```bash
node bin/starlight-platform.js demo --example service-health --events --timeout-ms 10000
```

It fetches three service-health records, verifies them, and writes a Markdown report with
read-back verification. See [API agents and mission validation](docs/HTTP_AGENTS.md) to connect
your own service. `starlight validate <mission.json>` checks a plan without running agents;
the SDK equivalent is `validateMission(mission)`.

## The protocol underneath

```text
Mission → AgentPlatform → Coordinator → selected agent → outcome → run report
                             │
                             └── ProtocolHub ↔ remote Sentinels
```

“Sentinel” is the protocol name for an agent. Existing `Coordinator`, `ProtocolHub`, `Sentinel`,
and `Starlight` exports remain available, including through `/core`. The language-neutral
JSON-RPC/WebSocket wire contract remains **1.0**.

Local agents need no server. Remote agents connect through a `ProtocolHub` sharing
`platform.coordinator`; see the [agent guide](docs/AGENTS.md). Network authentication is mandatory
by default. The protocol CLI remains `starlight-core`, requiring `STARLIGHT_AUTH_TOKEN` unless
anonymous loopback development is explicitly enabled.

## Boundaries that matter

- Agents are trusted code with the host's permissions. Starlight is not a sandbox.
- Constraints are passed intact; agents and verifiers enforce their meaning.
- Capacity applies per registration. Different agents sharing a resource need a common owner or external lock.
- Agents must honor `execution.signal`. Cancellation cannot forcibly stop or undo external work.
- The platform stops on ambiguous errors and timeouts. Explicit `retry` or `unhandled` outcomes authorize another attempt or agent.
- The SDK retains 100 runs in memory by default and supports optional file storage. The CLI saves progress checkpoints; neither API automatically resumes or replays interrupted work.
- Core intent replay is bounded and process-local, not durable exactly-once delivery.
- Remote handlers receive an AbortSignal. Timed-out work retains capacity until settlement or disconnection; the Sentinel SDK preserves local capacity across reconnects.
- Reports include context and evidence. Keep secrets in agent configuration rather than mission data.

## Validate changes

```bash
npm test
npm run proof:e2e
npm run release:gate
```

The release gate runs runtime/CLI tests, lint, declarations, schema checks, the TCK, an
authenticated multi-process proof, installed-package CLI/demo verification, and a production
and development dependency audit. It does not publish anything.

The old browser implementation, recordings, obsolete declarations, and generated artifacts have
been removed from the versioned project. Git history preserves the previous implementation.
