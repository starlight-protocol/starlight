## [3.0.1] - 2026-01-01

### 🔧 No-Code Marker HUD Fixes

#### Fixed
- **Checkpoint Button**: Now uses in-HUD text input instead of browser `prompt()` which was intercepted by Playwright
- **Stop Recording Button**: Now works directly without `confirm()` dialog for seamless recording termination
- **Function Exposure Order**: Recording functions are now exposed BEFORE page navigation to ensure they're available in the page context
- **Browser Isolation**: Recording now launches a completely fresh browser instance to avoid dialog handler conflicts

#### Changed
- **HUD Design**: Added dedicated checkpoint name input field directly in the HUD panel
- **Recording Flow**: Restructured into three steps: (1) Expose functions, (2) Navigate, (3) Inject HUD
- **Mission Control Integration**: Recording sessions now correctly capture checkpoints and stop signals

## [3.0.0] - 2026-01-01

### 🌌 Phase 16: The Autonomous Era (World-Class Recorder)

#### Added
- **Mutation Fingerprinting**: Test Recorder now captures environmental "stability signatures"
  - Injected `MutationObserver` measures DOM settle time after every user interaction
  - Encodes `stabilityHint` metadata into generated intent scripts
- **Autonomous CLI Orchestrator (`starlight.js`)**: Zero-touch lifecycle management
  - Single command `node bin/starlight.js <mission>` launches Hub and all Sentinels
  - Automatic process cleanup and standardized exit codes (0 for success, 1 for failure)
  - Headless mode support for CI/CD environments
- **Hub Health Check**: New `http://localhost:8080/health` endpoint for orchestration polling
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Sample workflow for automated Starlight missions
- **Failure-Safe Reporting**: Hub now generates a "Mission Failure" report immediately on error, ensuring evidence is captured even in catastrophic runs.

#### Changed
- **PulseSentinel**: Now context-aware; dynamically adjusts settlement windows based on `stabilityHint`
- **IntentRunner**: Automatically closes WebSocket connections on mission finish, preventing process hanging
- **Mission Control UI**: Now dynamically discovers new recording scripts and hydrates the mission dropdown in real-time.

## [2.8.0] - 2024-12-31

### 🛡️ Phase 9: Sovereign Security & Compliance (Shadow DOM)

#### Added
- **Shadow DOM Penetration**: Deep-piercing selectors for encapsulated web components
  - Hub `resolveSemanticIntent` now recursively traverses shadow roots
  - Hub `broadcastPreCheck` detects obstacles inside shadow boundaries
  - `executeSentinelAction` clears obstacles across shadow DOM
- **`config.json` → `shadowDom`**: New configuration section
  - `enabled`: Toggle shadow DOM traversal (default: true)
  - `maxDepth`: Maximum shadow root traversal depth (default: 5)
- **`test/shadow_test.html`**: Test page with custom web component
- **`test/intent_shadow.js`**: Intent script for shadow DOM missions

#### Changed
- **JanitorSentinel**: Added shadow-piercing patterns (`>>> .modal`, `>>> .popup`)
- **Sovereign Remediation**: Now traverses shadow roots when clearing obstacles

---

### 🛠️ Phase 8: Codebase Hardening & Quality Fixes

#### Added
- **`config.json`**: Centralized configuration file for all hardcoded values
  - Hub settings: port, syncBudget, missionTimeout, heartbeatTimeout, lockTTL
  - Aura settings: predictiveWaitMs, bucketSizeMs
  - Sentinel settings: settlementWindow, reconnectDelay, heartbeatInterval
  - Vision settings: model, timeout, ollamaUrl
- **`requirements.txt`**: Python dependencies with pinned versions
- **Screenshot Cleanup**: Auto-removes screenshots older than 24 hours at Hub startup
- **Trace Rotation**: Mission trace limited to 500 events (configurable)
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Sentinels now handle SIGINT/SIGTERM, saving memory before exit

#### Changed
- **PulseSentinel**: Migrated to inherit from `SentinelBase` (SDK consistency)
- **Sync Budget**: Reduced default from 90s to 30s (configurable)
- **Exception Handling**: Replaced bare `except:` blocks with proper error handling
- **File Persistence**: Memory files now use atomic writes (temp file + rename)
- **DataSentinel**: Now extracts real command/goal data instead of fake tokens

#### Fixed
- **Janitor Learning Race Condition**: Now tracks all tried selectors correctly
- **SDK Message Handling**: Non-blocking protocol processing with `asyncio.create_task`
- **Path Handling**: Standardized `sys.path` approach across all sentinels
